# Keylogger
This project is about Keylogger. It is a basic cybersecurity project. Using this software we can track the key strokes and store them in a txt document that gets generated upon running the software.
THis can be used to track the movements of any person trying to sneak into your machine.
This can be also used for malicious purposes by keeping a record of the password that is being typed for any purpose.
